This project repository contains the jupyter notebooks that I wrote for my project at the European Space Angency (ESA) the summer of 2023. It contains 5 different files:

- Discarded_code.ipynb contains code that I created that I did not use at the end. Instead of deleting them I put the code into another file in case I needed it again.
- K-means.ipynb is code from another source that I worked into my code
- LEAPS project analysis.ipynb contains the analysis I did on the Gaia data
- LEAPS_project_functions.ipynb contains the functions that I created for the analysis
- Useful_project_functions contains the functions that I created for the analysis and a testing section for the functions that I used before importing them into the analysis notebook
